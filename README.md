This is some demo code from the Python on-line course,
which helps me to remind the fundamentals and syntax of Python3.

Since my memory is fish's fish's memory, this code can help me picking up the knowledge in a short time.
Hope these also helps others, too.

So, Enjoy!!

NOTE: Can only run by Python3
